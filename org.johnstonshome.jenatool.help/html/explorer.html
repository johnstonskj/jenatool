    <h2>The Jena Explorer View</h2>
	<p>
	  The Explorer View is used to manage connections to Jena stores, these
	  connection descriptions are persisted so developers can maintain a 
	  set of connections between Eclipse sessions. The view allows a user to 
	  add a new connection, delete a connection, close an open connection or
	  to set the selected connection to be the "default". The notion of a 
	  default connection is used for some fast-track actions so that the user
	  doesn't have to identify the target connection for these actions.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The following is an image of the explorer view with two connections, one
	  is open (denoted by the colored connection), one close (the connection
	  is greyed out) and one is marked as the default (with a marker glyph). 
	  While a user can close an open connection the opening of connections is
	  handled automatically by the tool on demand.
