# Introduction #

The ability to execute SPARQL queries against a Jena store is a key feature of the tool. Currently a query can be executed from a context menu invoked from the navigator, although other options are possible.

## Run Query Action ##

By right-clicking on a SPARQL resource in the navigator the user can see the `Jena->Run Query` action, as shown in the figure below.

The query will be executed against the currently set default store in the Jena Explorer View (if no default has been set then the user is prompted with a warning message). The results of the query are shown in the SPARQL Results View.
