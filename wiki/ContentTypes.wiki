= Introduction =

The tools supports the identification, editing and custom actions specific to a number of RDF-related resource types. To this end the tool registers Eclipse content-types for these resource types as well as custom editor entries although currently no type specific editing functions are provided. 

== Supported Types ==

The following lists the supported content types, the file extensions they are mapped to and the base Eclipse editor used to edit them.

||  *Type*  ||  *Extensions*  ||  *Editor* ||  *Comments*  ||
|| SPARQL || `.sparql` || text || A SPARQL query. ||
|| N-Triples || `.nt` || text || RDF content in N-Triple format. ||
|| Turtle || `.ttl` || text || RDF content in Turtle format. ||
|| N3 || `.n3` || text || RDF content in N3 format. ||
|| RDF/XML || `.rdf` || xml || RDF content in RDF/XML format. ||

== New RDF File Wizard ==

The following shows the wizard invoked from the `File->New->Other...` menu, it will create a new RDF/XML resource and will include template code based on the settings in the wizard.

Currently the only configuration is the option to include the subject URL in the created resource, though this is optional and may be left blank. The following is the template code generated by the wizard.

{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="">
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
}}}

== New SPARQL Query Wizard ==

The following shows the wizard invoked from the `File->New->Other...` menu, it will create a new SPARQL query resource and will include template code based on the settings in the wizard.

Each of the query forms `SELECT`, `ASK`, `DESCRIBE` and `CONSTRUCT` are supported and a distinct template is used for each. The following is an example template generated for a `SELECT` query:

{{{
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
SELECT ?value
WHERE
{
  ?s <http://example.org/v/some-predicate> ?value
}
}}}
