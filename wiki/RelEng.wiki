#summary Release procedures (reminders and gotchas).

= Introduction =

Release engineering shouldn't be hard, and indeed isn't, but if it's not documented it *will* go wrong one day.

== Create Tag ==

{{{
svn copy https://jenatool.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ https://jenatool.googlecode.com/svn/tags/{version} -m "Declaring {version} release"
}}}


== Create Update Site ==

To create/install a build to the update site.

  # Open site.xml
  # Run the "Build All" command to create all the necessary artifacts
  # Open the S3 bucket at http://jenatool.s3.amazonaws.com/
  # Copy the following files *only* to the S3 bucket:
    * `features/*`
    * `plugins/*`
    * `site.xml`
  # Specifically, do not copy artifacts.xml and content.xml.
  # Zip up the same contents as were copied to S3 and name them:
    * `org.johnstonshome.jenatool.{version}.zip`
  # Add the zip file to the Google Code project Downloads.
